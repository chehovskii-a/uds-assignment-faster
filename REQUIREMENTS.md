You are tasked with designing and implementing a small component library called “Faster” for the company's Design System.

The library should include:
•	Button
•	Input
•	Dialog

The components should be:
•	Production-ready
•	Fully tested
•	Built using reusable design tokens
•	Well-documented in Storybook with interactive controls
•	Integrated with CI/CD automation

You will need to run the library locally and present your approach. We'll use this presentation to discuss your decisions, trade-offs, component architecture, testing strategy, accessibility considerations, and design system thinking.
In addition, please publish your solution to GitHub so that the implementation can be reviewed before the presentation session.
Implementation Stack
React · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Jest · Cypress · Storybook · GitHub Actions
 
Tech Stack
- React — Component framework
- TypeScript (TSX) — Type-safe development
- Tailwind CSS — Utility-first styling
- Design Tokens — Required for colors and scalability
- Jest — Unit testing
- Cypress — Component and interaction testing
- Storybook — Documentation and interactive component exploration
- GitHub Actions — CI/CD automation
 
Process
Step 1 — Review the Figma File
Before writing any code:
- Open the provided Figma file
- Use the Inspect panel to extract design specifications: 
    - Typography (font size, weight, line height)
    - Colors
    - Borders / radius
    - Spacing and layout
    - States (default, hover, focus, disabled, error)
Ensure you fully understand the components, variants, states, and behaviors before implementation.
 
Step 2 — Define Design Tokens
Create a reusable token structure for colors.
Requirements:
•	Do not hardcode colors directly inside components
•	Define centralized color tokens
•	Ensure tokens are reusable and scalable within a design system context
You may use:
•	TypeScript token files
•	Tailwind theme extension
•	CSS Variables
•	Combination of the above
 
Step 3 — Build the Components
Implement the following components:
•	Button
•	Input
•	Dialog
Requirements for all components:
•	TypeScript support
•	Tailwind CSS styling
•	Accessibility best practices
•	Reusable and scalable API
•	Alignment with Figma specifications
•	Usage of design tokens
 
Step 4 — Write Tests
Jest + React Testing Library
Create tests covering:
•	Component rendering
•	Variants and states
•	User interactions
•	Accessibility where applicable
Cypress (Mandatory)
Create component tests covering:
•	Successful mounting
•	Basic rendering validation
•	Component interactions
•	Dialog open/close behavior
•	Input interactions
•	Button interactions
 
Step 5 — Create Storybook Stories
Create Storybook documentation for all components.
Requirements:
•	Write stories for all component variants
•	Include disabled, error, and interaction states where applicable
•	Include a Playground story with full control exposure
•	Ensure stories are clear, structured, and useful for other developers
 
Step 6 — Configure CI/CD and NPM Library
Create a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs:
•	Install Dependencies
•	Lint
•	Type Check
•	Jest Tests
•	Cypress Tests
•	Storybook Build
•	Production Build
•	NPM Library Release
The goal is to demonstrate that the component library is protected by automated quality checks.
 
Step 7 — Publish Repository & Storybook
Please publish your solution to a GitHub repository.
Before the presentation session, we should be able to:
•	Review the code on GitHub
•	Run the project locally
•	Access and review the local  Storybook documentation
 
Acceptance Criteria
•	Components match the Figma design and specifications
•	Component APIs and behavior are well-structured and consistent
•	Design tokens are implemented and used consistently
•	All Jest tests pass
•	All Cypress tests pass
•	Storybook provides full control and visibility of the components
•	No console errors in Storybook
•	CI/CD pipeline executes successfully
•	Repository can be cloned and run locally
 
Deliverables
Please provide:
•	GitHub Repository URL
•	README with setup instructions
•	Jest tests
•	Cypress tests
•	GitHub Actions workflow
•	NPM Library
 
Presentation Session
Please be prepared to walk us through:
•	Figma analysis and implementation approach
•	Component architecture
•	Design token strategy
•	Accessibility decisions
•	Testing approach
•	Storybook setup
•	CI/CD workflow
•	Trade-offs and improvements
•	How you would scale Faster UI as a larger design system
